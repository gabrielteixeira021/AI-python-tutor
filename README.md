- **Data Structures**: Lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, searching, recursion
- **Libraries and Frameworks**: NumPy, Pandas, Flask, Django, and more
- **Best Practices**: Code organization, error handling, debugging
- **Problem Solving**: Algorithm design and implementation strategies

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **AI Provider**: Groq API
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Model**: OpenAI GPT-OSS-20B (via Groq)

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Groq API key (free at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com))
- Internet connection for API calls

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd dsa_AI_assistant
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
# Using conda (if you have Anaconda/Miniconda)
conda create -n ai_python_coder_assistant python=3.9
conda activate ai_python_coder_assistant

# Or using venv
python -m venv ai_python_coder_assistant
# On Windows:
ai_python_coder_assistant\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source ai_python_coder_assistant/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install streamlit groq
```

### 4. Get Your Groq API Key
1. Visit [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Generate your API key
4. Keep it secure - you'll enter it in the app's sidebar

### 5. Run the Application
```bash
streamlit run AI_python_Assistant.py
```

The application will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Enter API Key**: In the sidebar, paste your Groq API key
2. **Ask Questions**: Type your Python programming questions in the chat input
3. **Get Structured Answers**: Receive detailed responses with:
   - Clear conceptual explanations
   - Working code examples with comments
   - Step-by-step code breakdowns
   - Links to official Python documentation
4. **Continue Learning**: Build on previous questions in the same session

### Example Questions to Try:
- "How do I create a list in Python?"
- "Explain the difference between append() and extend() methods"
- "How can I read a CSV file using pandas?"
- "What are Python decorators and how do I use them?"
- "How do I handle exceptions in Python?"

## 🔧 Configuration

The assistant is configured with specific behavior rules:

- **Domain Focus**: Only responds to programming-related questions
- **Response Structure**: Always includes explanation → code → breakdown → documentation
- **Temperature**: Set to 0.7 for balanced creativity and accuracy
- **Max Tokens**: Limited to 2048 for comprehensive but focused responses
